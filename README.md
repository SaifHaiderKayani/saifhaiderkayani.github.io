## Projects
### Development of low-carbon aluminum alloy with simultaneous implementation of multiple characteristics and greenhouse gas reduction of over 40% based on high-efficiency electric arc melting. (_2024 - 2027_)
- Funding: $0.2M
- Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, South Korea
- Principle Investigator: Young-Hee Cho  
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Development of 200℃/250MPa grade composite aluminum casting alloy and brake disc/friction material manufacturing technology. (_2022 - 2026_)
- Funding: $0.2M
- Defense Acquisition Program Administration, South Korea
- Principle Investigator: Jung-Moo Lee          
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
