<h1>Al-Driven Alloy Design</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p align="justify">The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in alloy design is revolutionizing material development, particularly for high-performance aluminum alloys. Through data-driven approaches, AI can identify and optimize alloy compositions, processing parameters, and microstructure-property relationships. Explainable AI was used to design high-strength aluminum alloys by predicting and enhancing age-hardening behavior, offering insights into the alloying elements and their impact on mechanical properties. By leveraging AI, these approaches enable more efficient alloy design, reduce experimental costs, and promote the development of sustainable, high-performance materials.</p>
