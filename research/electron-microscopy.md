<h1>Advanced Electron Microscopy</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p align="justify">Advanced electron microscopy techniques, particularly Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), have become essential for characterizing small-scale features in materials, such as short-range order, precipitates, and atomic arrangements. In recent studies, TEM has been used to directly observe the chemical short-range order in 25 wt% Mn steel, providing insights into atomic-level interactions and alloy behavior. Similarly, TEM has revealed the atomic structure of β″ precipitates in high-Si Al-Si-Mg alloys, shedding light on the precipitation mechanisms that influence material properties. Additionally, TEM was employed to characterize the crystallographic structure of Al18Mg3Ti2 intermetallics in Al–Zn–Mg–Cu–Zr–Ti alloys, allowing for a deeper understanding of phase stability and their role in alloy performance. These applications highlight the power of TEM in investigating complex material systems at the atomic scale, providing critical information for improving material design and performance.</p>
