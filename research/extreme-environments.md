<h1>Materials for Extreme Environments</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p align="justify">In materials designed for extreme environments, such as high temperatures and corrosive conditions, intermetallic particles play a critical role in both corrosion behavior and high-temperature deformation. In alloys like Al-Si-Cu-Ni and Al-Si-Mg-Cu-Mn, intermetallics act as cathodic sites that can accelerate pitting corrosion, particularly under chloride exposure, by altering local electrochemical potentials. On the other hand, these particles influence high-temperature tensile properties by interacting with dislocations. While they can enhance strength through dislocation pinning, they may also lead to thermal instability or localized failure. The balance between mechanical strength and corrosion resistance is thus dependent on the distribution and behavior of intermetallics, making them critical for alloy performance in extreme environments.</p>

<h3>Principle of Thermal rate treatment during melting</h3>

<p align="justify">TRT offers a simple and effective approach to enhancing solute homogeneity while minimizing casting defects. TRT involves superheating the molten alloy to approximately 250–300 °C above its liquidus temperature. This process significantly increases the thermal energy of the alloy, leading to the dissociation of ordered solute clusters into individual atoms. Following this superheating, the melt is maintained at the elevated temperature for a specified duration before undergoing rapid cooling. While the breakdown of solute clusters reduces the number of effective nucleation sites, it ensures that solute homogeneity is preserved up to the solidus temperature, resulting in fewer nucleation events during solidification.</p>
