<h1>Materials for Extreme Environments</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p align="justify">In materials designed for extreme environments, such as high temperatures and corrosive conditions, intermetallic particles play a critical role in both corrosion behavior and high-temperature deformation. In alloys like Al-Si-Cu-Ni and Al-Si-Mg-Cu-Mn, intermetallics act as cathodic sites that can accelerate pitting corrosion, particularly under chloride exposure, by altering local electrochemical potentials. On the other hand, these particles influence high-temperature tensile properties by interacting with dislocations. While they can enhance strength through dislocation pinning, they may also lead to thermal instability or localized failure. The balance between mechanical strength and corrosion resistance is thus dependent on the distribution and behavior of intermetallics, making them critical for alloy performance in extreme environments.</p>

<h3>Stress Corrosion Cracking in High-Strength Al-Zn-Mg-Cu Alloys</h3>

<p align="justify">TIn high-strength Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is a significant concern, particularly under tensile stress in corrosive environments. The mechanism involves a combination of electrochemical behavior and dislocation dynamics. In these alloys, the presence of precipitates, such as η-phase (MgZn2), plays a key role in the SCC process. Dislocations interact with these precipitates, leading to localized strain accumulation and electrochemical potential differences at the interface, which can promote the initiation of cracks. The precipitate-matrix interface acts as a weak point where corrosion can propagate, especially in chloride-rich environments. The dislocation-aided electrochemical interactions at these interfaces accelerate crack growth by facilitating the penetration of corrosive agents, ultimately reducing the alloy’s mechanical integrity under stress. Understanding these interactions is crucial for improving the corrosion resistance and fracture toughness of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys in high-performance applications.</p>
